# secretsauce

Herein lies a motley collection of helper functions that I use in my day-to-day as an analyst in the insurance industry. If you analyse data concerning people and money, you may get some use out of this package too.

**Why *secret sauce*?**

As R packages are often loaded at the start of R scripts, calling `library(secretsauce)` is like garneshing your code with that little something extra... #spicycode


## Installation

As secretsauce is primarily for my personal use it is not on CRAN (and probably never will be). Fear not however, you can install it directly from GitHub: 
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("liam-c-smith/secretsauce")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
