# secretsauce

Herein lies a motley collection of helper functions that I use in my day-to-day as an analyst in the insurance industry. If you analyse data concerning people and money, you may get some use out of this package too.

**Why *secret sauce*?**

As R packages are often loaded at the start of R scripts, calling `library(secretsauce)` is like garneshing your code with that little something extra. #spicycode


## Installation

As secretsauce is primarily for my personal use it is not on CRAN (and probably never will be). Fear not however, you can install it directly from GitHub: 
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("liam-c-smith/secretsauce")
```
